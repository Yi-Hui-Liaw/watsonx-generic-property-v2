  "description": "The alluring external aesthetics extends to the interior, in the residential apartments, serviced apartments and 3 levels of facilities. The 1-, 2- and 3-bedroom residences are presented as three collections: the Stratus (levels 10 to 30), the Cumulus (levels 32 to 60); and the Australis (levels 63 to 85). Generous community spaces—designed to supplement an urban lifestyle—extend across three different levels: the Stratus Club (Level 8), Cumulus Club (Level 61), and the Australis Club (Level 86), each with increasing exclusive residential access. The inordinate number of facilities include a 25-metre lap pool, gymnasiums, private cinemas, private and formal entertainment venues with self-catering kitchens, and a viewing lounge on the very top floor. From the apartments and various vantage points in the building, the city sprawls out below and merges with Port Philip Bay, the public gardens and Dandenong Ranges. By just taking a few steps out of Aurora, all the conveniences and opportunities offered by the Melbourne CBD are within your grasp, and you will have unprecedented direct access from your home to the Melbourne metro network, via the Melbourne Central Station no less.",
