## Generic Property Demo
An AI pipeline using synthetic data to demonstrate different use cases. The purpose of this is for us to be able showcase the demo to potential clients without breaking NDA.

This demo is aimed to be as low code as possible, hence we will be building this following the documentation [here](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/41f6d6d519384e2f97aa5e8ddc7cfb589a8e9b4d/integrations/extensions/starter-kits/language-model-conversational-search#example-1-connect-your-assistant-to-elasticsearch-and-watsonx-via-custom-extensions)

The use cases included as part of this demo:
- RAG pattern
